## How to Add CSS

Thre ways of inserting a style sheet.
    External CSS
    Internall CSS

External CSS

    An external style sheet. Able to change the look of the website from a single file. Each HTML page must have a reference to the external seet inside the the head section.

Inline CSS

    An inline style may be used to apply a unique style to a single element.
    The style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS property.

Cascading Order

    What style will be used when there is more than one style specified for an HTML element?
    All the styles in a page will "cascade" into a new "virtual" style sheet by the following rules, where number one has the highest priority:

    1. Inline style (inside an HTML element)
    2. External and internal style sheets (in the head section)
    3. Browser default
    So, an inline style has the highest priority, and will override external and internal styles and browser defaults
