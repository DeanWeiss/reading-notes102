# Programming with Javascript Reading

Control Flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script. Control flow means that when you read a script, you must not only read from start to finish but also look at program strucure and how it affects order of execution.

A javascript function is defined with the 'function' keyword, followed by  a name, followed by parentheses `()`.

The code to be executed, by function, is placed inside the curly brackets `{}`

example `function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {`
  `// code to be executed`
`}`

When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing. If the function was invoked from a statement, JavaScript will "return" to execute the code after the invoking statement. Functions often compute a return value. The return value is "returned" back to the "caller":

You can reuse functions. Define the code once, and use it manytimes.

Lcoal Variables declared within Javascript function, become LOCAL to the function. Local variables can only be acccessed from within the function.

JavaScript Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic on numbers:

Javascripts has the following types of operators.
<li>
    <ol>
        Assignment operators
        Comparison operators
        Arithmetic operators
        Bitwise operators
        Logical operators
        String operators
        Conditional (ternary) operator
        Comma operator
        Unary operators
        Relational operators
    </ol>
</li

Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedure—a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.
