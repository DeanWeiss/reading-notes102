Javascript is a lightweigh, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language. Javascript is not the same as Java Programming language.
4 ways to declare a java script variable
ver, let, const and use nothing.
Variables are containers for storing data.

General rule, always declare variables with 'const' 
If you think the value of the of the variable can change, use 'let'

Example:
The two variables price1 and price2 are declared with the const keyword.
These are constant values and cannot be changed.
The variable total is declared with the let keyword.
This is a value that can be changed.

All javascript variables must be identified with unique names - Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).
