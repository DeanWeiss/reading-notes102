## What is 'growth mindset'  

* *Growth mindset is akin to a flowing stream.* * You must constantly be moving forward, open to new ideas and be able to accept criticism. You should see the success of other around you as a success for everyone and not with jealousy. It's when the stream stops flowing that it becomes stagnate, when we stop learning and become jealous of what others have achieved is when our Growth Mindset has stopped. 

### This is how I will keep myself in a growth mindset

* **Continue to learn,** and seek out ways to improve how you learn.
* **Teach others**, you do not master something until you can teach someone what it is you are doing.
* **Remember to take breaks**, your mind needs time to digest what it has learned, walk away and come back after youâ€™ve had some time to reset.
