## What is 'growth mindset'  

* *Growth mindset is akin to a flowing stream.*  
- You must constantly be moving forward, open to new ideas and be able to accept criticism. 
- You should see the success of other around you as a success for everyone and not with jealousy. 
- It's when the stream stops flowing that it becomes stagnate. 
  - When we stop learning and become jealous of what others have achieved is when our Growth Mindset has stopped. 

### This is how I will keep myself in a `growth mindset`

* **Continue to learn,** and seek out ways to improve how you learn.
* **Teach others**, you do not master something until you can teach someone what it is you are doing.
* **Remember to take breaks**, your mind needs time to digest what it has learned, walk away and come back after youâ€™ve had some time to reset.
